## Work Process

Our development process is iterative and divided into the following phases:

1. **Backend Stabilization:**  
   - Validate that core functionalities (login, registration, post creation, profile viewing) are working as expected.

2. **UI Development:**  
   - Transition to designing and developing the user interface for a better user experience.

3. **Integration:**  
   - Ensure seamless integration between the backend and UI.
   - Confirm that interactive features such as liking and following are properly reflected in both layers.

4. **Feature Expansion:**  
   - After integration, expand backend features (e.g., reporting, commenting, notifications, messaging).

5. **Testing & Optimization:**  
   - Conduct thorough testing at each phase.
   - Optimize both backend and frontend for performance and user experience.

## Conclusion

The Ryve project is currently equipped with essential backend features: user authentication, post creation, and detailed profile viewing with privacy settings. The next phase is to build a user-friendly UI starting with login and registration pages, followed by the home feed and user profile pages. Once the UI is in place and integrated with the current backend, additional features such as post reporting, comments, notifications, and messaging will be implemented.
